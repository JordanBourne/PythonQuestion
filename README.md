Data engineer for UnCheck team interview question.

There are two questions: 
  - The first question is in `question.py`
    - The first version of the question uses `payments_no_typo.csv` initially
    - More complicated version can use `payments.csv`
  - The second question is in `secondQuestion.py`
    - This uses the `mockZoho.py` file to act as the zoho api and a small system of record
