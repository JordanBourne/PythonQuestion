'''
Given the payments.csv file which contains a list of 10,000 payments to random business and addresses,
find unique businesses contained within the payments list, and provide the most common name for the business

Note: Each business can have several distinct addresses.
It would be helpful to us to be able to be aware of each unique address,
but also how the addresses are grouped
